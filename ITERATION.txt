We received two major pieces of feedback: that there is a major lack of guidance, and
that the game is in general too hard and confusing. We Added a basic tutorial area to
our level, and incorporated guidance as part of required brief dialogue with an NPC.
We also added videos to the shop that showcase what each item/upgrade does. The title
screen also shows how the radar works. Hopefully added guidance addresses the difficulty,
but we also raised the player's default battery capacity, made the radar cheap and easily
accessible from the start, made underground batteries more plentiful, and added upgrades
to the battery to make it last longer. We also removed enemies that were unnoticable
and would kill the player unfairly.
